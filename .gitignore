# IMPORTANT: DO NOT ignore the model directory or pickle files
# These are essential for deployment and must be in the repository
# If you see any lines below trying to ignore model files, remove them:
# 
# The following lines are COMMENTED OUT to ensure model files are tracked:
# model/
# *.pkl
# *.pickle
# 
# Your model files MUST be committed to GitHub for deployment to work!
